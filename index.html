    <h2>Addendum:</h2>
    <p>In developing this interactive Cyberpunk Adventure, I aimed to create a compelling narrative with diverging paths and meaningful choices for the player. The cyberpunk theme inspired the storyline, and I carefully selected corresponding images to enhance the immersive experience.</p>
    
    <p>During the coding process, one challenge I faced was ensuring smooth transitions between story stages and updating the user interface dynamically. This was overcome by structuring the code efficiently and using event listeners to capture user choices.</p>

    <p>Additionally, styling the interface posed a creative challenge. I opted for a dark, cyberpunk-inspired color scheme to complement the theme, and I applied responsive design principles for better user experience across devices.</p>

    <p>Insights gained include the importance of balancing narrative depth with user engagement and the significance of user interface design in interactive storytelling.</p>
